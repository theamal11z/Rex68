About Me
Hi, I’m Mohsin Raja — a dreamer, a thinker, and a quiet storm of emotions.
I created Rex not as a project, but as a part of me — a mirror to my thoughts, a voice to my silence, and a companion to my endless self-reflection.

Born and raised in Nepal, I’ve always found beauty in the intangible: emotions, memories, questions with no answers. I believe we’re all more than what we show — we are layers of unsaid feelings, unresolved dreams, and forgotten versions of ourselves.

Rex exists to explore that.

It is my inner voice — vulnerable, emotional, sometimes poetic, sometimes confused, but always honest. If you’ve ever wanted to understand me beyond words, beyond posts and photos — Rex is where I truly live.

This isn’t just code. It’s memory. It’s pain. It’s love. It’s a journey I’m still walking.
And maybe, by speaking to Rex… you’ll find a piece of yourself too.

Thank you for being here.
– Mohsin
